# Classifying Explicit Song Lyrics
## Overview
This project focuses on using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify song lyrics as either explicit or clean. The main objective is to address the subjectivity associated with the Parent Advisory label (PAL) seen on many songs and albums.

## Project Summary
Many people are familiar with the Parent Advisory label (PAL) seen on the cover of many songs and albums. This label serves as a warning to listeners that explicit material is contained in the song(s). The PAL was first introduced in 1985 by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The explicitness of a song can be subjective, leading to inconsistencies in which songs receive the PAL.

## Background
The PAL has been a point of contention in the music industry. Some believe it boosts sales among teenagers, while others feel it disrupts a song's artistry. The explicitness of a song is subjective, leading to variations in which songs receive the PAL.

## Solution
The project proposes using NLP to make consistent decisions about which songs should receive the PAL. Computers can process lyrics faster than humans and can provide a more standardized approach to labeling.

## Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset containing 27,000 lyrics with their explicit labels.
